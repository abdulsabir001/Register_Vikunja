Step-by-Step Instructions:
Set Up Python Environment:

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can check this by running python --version in your command prompt or terminal.
Install the necessary libraries. You need selenium and unittest. You can install Selenium by running:
pip install selenium
Download the WebDriver:
Download the appropriate WebDriver for the browser you intend to use (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome).
Ensure that the WebDriver is compatible with your browser version.
Add the WebDriver to your systemâ€™s PATH or place it in the same directory as your Python script.
Save the Script:

Copy the provided Python script into a new .py file. For example, name it test_vikunja_registration.py.
Run the Script:
Open a command prompt or terminal.
Navigate to the directory where your test_vikunja_registration.py file is saved.
Run the script by executing:
python test_vikunja_registration.py
